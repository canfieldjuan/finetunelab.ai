{"prompt":"What is machine learning?","chosen":"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on training algorithms to learn patterns from data, enabling systems to improve their performance on tasks without explicit programming.","rejected":"Machine learning is just AI stuff."}
{"prompt":"Explain deep learning.","chosen":"Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep') to learn hierarchical representations of data, allowing for complex pattern recognition in tasks like image and speech recognition.","rejected":"Deep learning is when computers think deeply."}
{"prompt":"What is supervised learning?","chosen":"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled datasets, meaning each training example includes both input features and the correct output, allowing the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs.","rejected":"It's learning with a supervisor watching you."}
