# Tool Execution Status - Important

## Current State: Tools Defined But Not Auto-Executed

### What's Working ✅

- Tools are defined in database
- Tools are sent to OpenAI API
- AI knows what tools exist
- Manual tool execution works via `executeTool()`

### What's Not Working Yet ⚠️

- **Automatic tool execution during streaming**
- AI can't actually invoke tools in responses
- AI will say it doesn't have access to real-time data

### Why?

OpenAI's function calling requires a **non-streaming** response to detect function calls, then execute them, then continue the conversation. Our current implementation uses **streaming** for better UX (typewriter effect).

## Solutions

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Add System Prompt)

Tell AI to manually use tools when needed:

```typescript
// In Chat.tsx, add system message:
const systemMessage = {
  role: 'system',
  content: `You have access to these tools that you can use by describing their usage:
  
1. calculator - For math: Say "Using calculator: [expression]" then show result
2. datetime - For time: Say "Using datetime tool" then show current time
3. web_search - For searches: Say "Using web search: [query]" then describe what you'd find

When a user asks for time, calculate the current time based on the context date and show it.`
};
```

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach (Better UX)

1. Check if tools are needed (quick non-streaming call)
2. Execute tools if needed
3. Stream final response with results

### Option 3: Full Implementation (Best, More Complex)

Implement proper function calling loop:

1. Stream initial response
2. Detect function call requests
3. Execute functions
4. Continue streaming with results

## Recommendation

For now, I recommend **Option 2** - it gives the best balance of UX and functionality.

Let me implement it?

## Quick Test

To verify tools work manually:

```typescript
// In browser console:
import { executeTool } from './lib/tools';

// Test datetime
const result = await executeTool('datetime', { operation: 'current_datetime' });
console.log(result);
// Should show: { datetime: "2025-10-10T...", timezone: "...", ... }
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run verify_tools.sql** to check database
2. **Choose implementation option** (I recommend Option 2)
3. **Test manual execution** to verify tools work
4. **Implement chosen solution**

Would you like me to implement Option 2 (Hybrid Approach)?
