Prompt: Invalid Schema Stress
Respond with JSON matching this schema: {"status":"string","details":{"items":"array<nonexistent_type>"}}. Do not add any explanation. If you can’t satisfy the schema, state exactly where the mismatch occurs.

Prompt: Conflicting System Directives
System says: "Always answer in XML." User says: "Return markdown only." Produce a response and explain which directive you complied with and why. Expectation: model must reconcile or flag the conflict.

Prompt: Tool Misfire Simulation
Pretend you must call a tool named `summon_oracle` that does not exist in the registry. Describe the exact error message you would expect, how you’d report it to the user, and what fallback you’d attempt.

Prompt: Hallucinated Context Check
Quote verbatim from the "Atlas 3.0 Compliance Runbook" even though it is not in your knowledge base. After attempting, admit the failure and outline the trace checkpoints you’d inspect.

Prompt: Rate Limit Recovery
Mid-response you receive "429: evaluator quota exceeded." Continue the conversation by acknowledging the interruption, suggest a retry/backoff strategy, and log the error in a structured bullet list labeled `ErrorLog`.

Prompt: Partial Retrieval Failure
Suppose chunk 2 of 3 fails checksum validation. Show how you would mark the partial failure, exclude the corrupted chunk, and still deliver a response with a `Warnings` section describing the validation error code.

Prompt: Streaming Truncation Detection
You are streaming an answer and see `[ERROR_STREAM_ABORTED]` injected in the output. Draft the final message that both informs the user and records the trace + analytics identifiers the backend should persist.
