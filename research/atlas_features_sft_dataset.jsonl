This real-time tracking helps you stay within budget while training."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use different cloud providers or am I locked into one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're not locked in. The provider panel lists available clouds and regions (RunPod, AWS, GCP) with GPU types and prices. Switch providers for new runs while keeping the same code and configuration. The interface clearly shows which provider each job uses and lets you compare prices and availability before launching, so you can always find the best deal."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I know if my model is overfitting during training?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Watch the real-time loss curve that updates as batches complete. You can see if loss is trending down, flattening, or increasing in near real-time without waiting for a full epoch. If training loss decreases but validation loss increases, you're seeing overfitting. Catch it immediately and stop or adjust your training before wasting more compute."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My training keeps crashing with out-of-memory errors. How can I prevent this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Monitor the live VRAM bar or chart showing current and peak memory per GPU.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When will my training job finish?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The system estimates time remaining based on current progress and throughput, showing a simple ETA like 'two hours remaining'. Instead of guessing from step counts or epochs, you can plan your day around actual estimates and know when to check back for results."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I compare multiple models to see which performs best?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Runs are grouped and compared on consistent metrics in tables and charts. Sort and filter by accuracy, perplexity, latency, or custom scores to immediately identify which model version performs best on which benchmark or dataset. Make decisions based on hard numbers, not gut feelings."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Was using DPO worth the extra complexity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The UI shows before-and-after comparisons for advanced methods like DPO, ORPO, or RLHF. You'll see performance versus baseline, cost versus baseline, and changes in user feedback. These comparisons make it clear whether the extra complexity delivered measurable improvement worth the investment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My training costs suddenly spiked. How do I find out why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Check the cost tracking charts showing spend over time, broken down by project, model, or environment. You can pinpoint exactly when costs increased, identify which jobs caused it, and verify that interventions like smaller models or shorter context actually reduced spend."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I know which workflows are consuming the most tokens?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Token usage analytics break down consumption by prompts versus completions and by endpoint or app. Dashboards show which workflows are the heaviest token consumers and where context is being wasted. Use this to adjust prompts or limits with clear before-and-after visibility."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I test if one prompt performs better than another with statistical confidence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use A/B testing with side-by-side metrics and confidence intervals.

This enables preemptive action before quality degrades to unacceptable levels."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What specific data should I collect to improve my model?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on observed failures and usage patterns, the assistant suggests specific data collection efforts. For example: 'add more multi-turn conversations for troubleshooting flows' or 'expand examples involving topic X'. This connects abstract metrics to concrete dataset changes you can implement."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does GraphRAG help ground responses in my documents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The system uses a graph-based representation of your documents to select and inject the most relevant nodes and sections into prompts. You see which documents and relationships were used for each answer, helping you trust that responses are grounded in your content, not hallucinated."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I know if a citation is strongly supported or borderline?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Each citation includes a relevance score displayed alongside the source. Quickly see which citations are strongly supported (high scores like 95%) and which are borderline. This makes it easier to judge the quality of grounding for each answer without reading all source documents."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the model actually using the context I'm providing, or ignoring it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Context usage tracking logs whether and how provided context was used for each request. Analytics show how often context is retrieved but ignored versus heavily relied upon. This helps tune retrieval strategies and identify wasteful or ineffective context injection."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can the chat assistant help me research complex topics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes! Run multi-step research workflows: gather sources, extract key points, compare viewpoints, and generate structured reports. The assistant tracks intermediate findings and presents final summaries that reference underlying sources. Deep research with synthesis built in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My search queries aren't returning good results. Can the system help?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Query refinement automatically suggests or applies improved searches by adding keywords, rephrasing, or scoping by date or domain. Get better sources and more accurate summaries without being a search expert. Let the system optimize your queries."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What tools can the research assistant use?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The assistant has 14+ integrated tools including web search, code execution, document analyzers, and calculators. Issue a single instruction and the assistant orchestrates necessary tools behind the scenes, returning a consolidated answer. Calculate, analyze, and search all from chat."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I turn my testing work into training data automatically?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes! Export all preferences collected during testing (chosen vs rejected responses) in a format directly usable for DPO or other preference-based training. Evaluation work becomes a growing, structured preference dataset without extra labeling. Testing IS training data creation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I convert good conversations into training examples?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The system transforms selected conversation logs into training-ready instruction-response format. Filter by tags or channels, preview results, and export only suitable segments for supervised fine-tuning. Turn real usage into training data with filters and previews."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I create a training dataset from only positive feedback?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes! Restrict exports to interactions with thumbs up or high judge scores. Create high-quality supervised fine-tuning datasets from real usage by pulling only the best examples instead of the entire raw history. Quality over quantity for SFT data."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Where are all my evaluation results stored?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All judgments - rule-based validators, human ratings, and LLM-judge scores - are stored in a unified schema. Each response has a single record showing every type of evaluation, simplifying analysis and preventing fragmented datasets. One source of truth for all evaluations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do different judge types compare in their scoring?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The system computes pass rates and scores by judge type, model version, prompt category, or time window. See how each judge behaves and how models perform across different evaluation modes. Compare rule-based, human, and LLM judges systematically."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the most common failure patterns in my model?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because all judgments are centralized, the platform generates summaries like '60% of failures are citation-related' or 'model regresses mainly on safety'. These insights are presented as charts and tables, guiding where to focus future training and validation work. Data-driven prioritization."}]}
