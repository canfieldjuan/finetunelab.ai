## 🔥 KILLER QUOTES TO USE

**For monitoring focus:**
> "Fine-tuning happens once. Monitoring lasts forever. We're the only platform that handles both."

**For training predictions:**
> "Would you drive with your eyes closed? Then why train models without seeing outputs?"

**For batch testing:**
> "Your model passed 5 test prompts. Will it pass 100? Find out before your customers do."

**For cost tracking:**
> "Most platforms hide costs until your credit card melts. We show you every cent, every request."

**For competitive positioning:**
> "From broken MLOps pipelines to production in one click - the only platform that handles fine-tuning, deployment, AND monitoring without DevOps nightmares."
