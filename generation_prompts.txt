**Factual Data for: AMD Phenom II X4 975?**
---
The AMD Phenom II X4 975 is a 4-core processor from AMD.
Base clock: 3.6GHz, boost: NoneGHz.
TDP: 125W.
Current price: $168.02.

Socket: AM4
Memory support: DDR4
Integrated graphics: None

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the AMD Phenom II X4 975?. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"
},
{
  "from": "assistant",
  "value": "While the AMD Phenom II X4 975? was a solid performer in its day, you might find it bottlenecks modern GPUs in some CPU-intensive games at 1080p. For a significant upgrade on a budget, you might consider something like a Ryzen 5 5600, which would offer a substantial performance uplift and put you on a more modern platform with an upgrade path. However, if you can get the AMD Phenom II X4 975? for a very low price and are pairing it with a mid-range GPU, it could still offer a decent experience for now."

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the AMD FX-9370?. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the Intel Core i7-11700F. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"

Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the Intel Core i5-8600?. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the Intel Core i3-3250. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"

1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the Intel Core i9-13900F?. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the Intel Core i5-14400F?. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the Intel Pentium E2160?. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"

Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Factual Data for: Intel Core i3-8350K**
---
The Intel Core i3-8350K is a 4-core processor from Intel.
Base clock: 4GHz, boost: NoneGHz.
TDP: 91W.
Current price: $135.00.

Socket: Check specifications
Memory support: DDR4
Integrated graphics: Intel UHD Graphics 630

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the Intel Core i3-8350K. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"
},
{

  "value": "While the Intel Core i3-8350K was a solid performer in its day, you might find it bottlenecks modern GPUs in some CPU-intensive games at 1080p. For a significant upgrade on a budget, you might consider something like a Ryzen 5 5600, which would offer a substantial performance uplift and put you on a more modern platform with an upgrade path. However, if you can get the Intel Core i3-8350K for a very low price and are pairing it with a mid-range GPU, it could still offer a decent experience for now."

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
{
  "from": "user",
  "value": "I'm thinking of upgrading my old CPU to the Intel Core i5-4670?. Is it still a good choice for 1080p gaming today, or should I save up for something more modern?"

Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Factual Data for: What RAM does the Intel Pentium G4600 support?**
---
The Intel Pentium G4600 supports DDR4.
---

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Factual Data for: What PSU wattage for the Intel Celeron E3300?**
---
For the Intel Celeron E3300 with 65W TDP, recommend at least 265W PSU (accounting for GPU and other components).
---

**Instructions:**
Generate 3 new, distinct instruction-response pairs. Each pair should be in a JSON format with "from": "user" and "from": "assistant".

**Requirements for the new examples:**
1.  **Do NOT create simple fact-lookup questions.** The base model already knows the facts.
2.  **Focus on reasoning and comparison.** The user should be asking for advice, comparing the component to others, or asking about its suitability for a specific use case (e.g., gaming, video editing, budget builds).
3.  **The assistant's response should be expert-level.** It should explain the "why" behind its recommendations, mentioning trade-offs and providing context.
4.  **Be creative.** The user personas can vary (e.g., a first-time builder, an enthusiast on a budget, a professional video editor).

**Example of a GOOD generated pair:**
