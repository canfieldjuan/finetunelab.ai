WHAT WE KNOW:
1. Terminal shows: "[API] Request with 118 messages, 2 tools"
   - 2 tools = calculator + datetime (web_search is disabled)
   
2. GraphRAG logs: "[GraphRAG] Enhanced prompt with 5 sources"
   - GraphRAG REPLACES the user message with enhanced version
   - Enhanced message contains document context
   
3. Calculator tool IS being called for "50 * 2"
   - Tool execution works correctly
   - Returns exact result: 100
   
HYPOTHESIS:
- For "23% of 456", the LLM might be finding the answer in GraphRAG context
- Instead of calling the calculator tool, it uses info from the 5 sources
- This would explain "approximately **104.88**" - it's reading, not calculating

WHAT TO CHECK:
1. What are the 5 GraphRAG sources for the query "test tools: what is 50 * 2?"
2. Does GraphRAG context contain math-related information?
3. Is the LLM choosing GraphRAG context over tool use?

SOLUTION OPTIONS:
A. Disable GraphRAG for tool-testing queries
B. Improve system prompt to prefer tools over context for calculations
C. Add GraphRAG skip logic for mathematical expressions
D. Check if shouldSkipGraphRAG() is working correctly

NEXT STEPS:
1. Check shouldSkipGraphRAG() function in route.ts
2. Add logging to show GraphRAG-enhanced message content
3. Test with GraphRAG temporarily disabled
